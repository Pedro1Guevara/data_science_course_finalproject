# Startup Success Analysis Project

This repository contains our final project for the Data Science course at UABC's Business Intelligence bachelor's degree program. The project analyzes startup survival patterns based on funding, industry sectors, and other key indicators using data from the "Big Startup Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase" available on Kaggle.

Using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, we investigated:
- The relationship between funding thresholds and startup survival
- Industry sector impact on success rates  
- The influence of funding rounds on company longevity

Project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, statistical inference, and machine learning models (logistic regression and K-means clustering) implemented in Python. Our analysis determined that approximately $64 million USD in funding is needed for a 99% survival probability, among other key findings.
